                <div class="indent">
                    <h3>How does BSBB decides which mesh to include when multiple exist?</h3>
                    <div class="indent">
                        There are multiple methods. First and most obvious is it must be included in the builds list either directly or via group.<br />
                        After that there are two (2) processes used when multiple still exist for any mesh. I do have ideas of more that may be added later.
                        <h4>Include Order</h4>
                        <div class="indent">
                            BSBB will look at all the available meshes for an output and see which would of been add first in the build's include list.
                            The include list can contain BodySlide groups or Outfit/Body names. So for any output mesh, include order priority will
                            find the first include entry that added a mesh. If that include entry was a name of an Outfit or Body then simple, it will use that.
                            If it was a group it will filter out any other meshes that were not also added by that group.
                        </div>
                        <h4>BuildSelection.xml</h4>
                        <div class="indent">
                            BodySlide's way of this is you can mark which alternative mesh should be used, and it writes it to this XML file. This is the check box in the lower left of the screen, where you can also right click to see the alternative meshes.<br />
                            If the file contains an entry for the mesh in question and the alternative mesh it points to exists in the current build, and hasn't already been filtered out by other methods, then it will use the mesh it points to.<br />
                            In the settings of BSBB you can change if this is used and if so is it used before or after the include order method.
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <h3>What happens if there are still multiple meshes after the above methods?</h3>
                    <div class="indent">
                        During validation it will detect these and be able to present them to you, and assist you with deciding what you want to do.<br />
                        First for each alternative mesh it will list the groups it is included in. This will help identify if you could resolve these by either adding a group to the include order or re-order the include list to resolve these.<br />
                        If however that is not an option, then like when you do a build all in BodySlide, in BSBB you can select which to use and have it automatically add them to the top of the include list for you.<br />
                        Unlike in BodySlide however this will only affect the current build configuration and not apply those selections to other builds you have.<br />
                        <br />
                        Lastly in the settings you can also disable this conflict checking during builds. This only disables it when using the "Build All" button and will still display these when manually running a validation.
                        This however will make BodySlide display it's normal window for any conflicts meaning you will need to accept them there each time.
                    </div>
                    <h3>What are the Ignored Slider Sets in the validations window?</h3>
                    <div class="indent">
                        These are just meshes that exist that are not included in any enabled build. Could be you don't want these or something you have missed.<br />
                        By default this is only done when running Validate All, but can be enabled in settings to run when you do Build All as well.
                    </div>
                    <h3>Can I see what Outfits / Bodies have been selected by BSBB?</h3>
                    <div class="indent">
                        Yes. BSBB creates slider groups for each build. Labeled "BSBB Group x", with x being the build number based on current order.<br />
                        So after running build all you can open BodySlide and look at the groups.<br />
                        These groups will be stored in the output mod specified in the settings screen. This can be set the same as Build output mods, but must be enabled to run Build All. <br />
                        Note: If you want to create / update these groups without also building you can hold control while clicking Build All, to only create / update the groups.
                    </div>
                    <h3>I get an error in BodySlide saying it can not create some output folders, what do I do?</h3>
                    <div class="indent">
                        This is a known bug, that nothing I have tried has fixed. It seems to only happen when running Build All when a output location doesn't already have a meshes folder (even though BSBB creates it first). <br />
                        So all you have to do is run Build All again, and it seems to be fine unless you manually delete the meshes folder or change output to somewhere new.<br />
                        Note the BSBB setting to clear the meshes folder before builds doesn't seem to affect this and is safe to use.

                        Note ignoring conflicts just moves the problem to inside BodySlide which will prompt you to decide which to use. If you resolve these in BSBB then you won't need to interact with BodySlide at all during build process.

                        The other is Locate button that will open Windows Explorer to the BSBB config file if you wish to find it easily to copy elsewhere. This is in the MO2\plugins\data folder.

                    This window will show you any errors, unresolved conflicts and Ignored Meshes. Depending on where the validation is triggered from more or less may be displayed.<br />
                    For instance when displayed due to problems detected during Build All validation, it will include an Ignore button that you can use to still run the builds, as long as no critical errors detected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For any conflicts I recommend first looking at the groups assigned, and updating your Include list accordingly with groups before adding any Outfits/Bodies to the include list if required.<br />
                    For instance in the above screenshot I would actually recommend adding the Hands Redone - Clothes group above the CBBE group in your Include list. But if you want to add the actual Outfits / Bodies you can do that from this screen by selecting those you want and clicking the Add to Builds button.<br />
                    Add to Builds will do that but not save any changes and take you back to the screen you came from to either check the results and if you want re-validate / Build All if you happy with the changes made.
