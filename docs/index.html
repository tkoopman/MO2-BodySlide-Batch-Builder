            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                This is a plug-in for MO2 that will run BodySlide automatically for multiple configured builds.
            </p>

            <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194" target="_blank">Mod Organizer 2</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201">BodySlide and Outfit Studio</a></li>
                <li>
                    Executable configured in MO2 (Ctrl+E) called "BodySlide x64".<br />
                    This is what automatically gets added when you have BodeSlide installed in MO2 normally.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Installation</h2>

            <p>
                Extract the downloaded file into your MO2\plugins folder. So you should have a folder x:\...\MO2\plugins\BSBB\
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>NOTE:</b> If you using v1.x of BSBB you should uninstall it first. It was a single file x:\...\MO2\plugins\BodySlideBatchBuilder.py<br />
                Configuration will not migrate from v1.x to v2 of BSBB as it was a complete re-design to try and make it more user friendly.<br />
                Any future upgrades should keep configuration.
            </p>
