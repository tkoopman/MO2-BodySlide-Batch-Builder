# BodySlide Batch Builder (BSBB)

This plugin for MO2 will run BodySlide automatically for multiple configured builds.

### Requires: 
  - MO2 of course
  - BodySlide installed in MO2 under mods folder
  - BodySlide Executable registered in MO2 as "BodySlide x64"

### Installation:
  - Place the folder BSBB in to your MO2/plugins/ folder.

### Help
[Help site](https://tkoopman.github.io/MO2-BodySlide-Batch-Builder/)

### Known Issues:
  - BodySlide build errors about not being able to create output folders.  
  Just re-run Build All as seems to only happen first time when Meshes folder doesn't 
  already exist in output mod, however nothing I have tried seems to fix it for me.
